# Habit Tracker - 4-Week Build Plan

A lightweight daily habit tracker that helps you build streaks, stay accountable, and visualize progress. Works offline as a PWA.

## What's included (Week 1)

✅ **Add & manage habits** (name, daily/weekly cadence)  
✅ **Daily check-ins** with toggle for today

✅ **Local persistence** (localStorage - works offline)  
✅ **Export/Import** data as JSON  
✅ **Mobile responsive** UI  

## Quick Start

1. **Open in browser** — Open `index.html` in any modern browser (no server needed)
2. **Add a habit** — Type a name, select cadence, click "Add Habit"

## Data Model

```json
{
  "habits": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id",
      "name": "Drink water",
      "cadence": "daily",
      "createdAt": "2025-11-12T10:30:00Z",
      "startDate": "2025-11-12"
    }
  ],
  "checkins": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id",
      "habitId": "habit-id",
      "date": "2025-11-12",
      "createdAt": "2025-11-12T14:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Acceptance Tests (Week 1)

1. ✅ Add habit → persists after page reload
2. ✅ Check-in for today → toggle shows active state, streak increases
3. ✅ Uncheck → streak recalculated correctly
4. ✅ Weekly summary → shows correct checks for test data
5. ✅ Export data → JSON file downloads correctly
6. ✅ Import data → loads habits and check-ins from file

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Storage:** localStorage
- **Deploy:** Static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)

## File Structure

```
/workspaces/Final-App-Project-/
